This part is after the formation of redux---
1.We remove the static data in the state from the reducer (ie. the initial state of the reducer)
by leaving the array empty and we're adding a boolean variable "loading" because for the fact,
we're gonna fetch the data from th API and this will be initially false and while fetching the data,
we change them to true and once the data fetched and returned, we will again make them false.
2.We need to create this as a type as we're having in our reducer.
as 
export const ITEMS_LOADING="ITEMS_LOADING"
====
The way we're gonna fetch the data s via axios, so we need to install it.
(Note:This need to be done in client side)
PS E:\MERN> cd client
PS E:\MERN\client> npm i axios
And once imported, use it ie import it in the Action Creator.
import axios from "axios" in the Action Creator.
