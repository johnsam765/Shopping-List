Heroku.
We could run npm run build in the client's package.json which will turn our react application
project into a static assets and can let us to upload but since our's is a full stack, we need to tak care of the node.
So we use Heroku.

server.js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    //Set static folder
    app.use(express.static('client/build'))
    app.get("*", (req, res) => {
        res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, "client", "build", "index.html"));
    })
}
Meaning if it's in the production, then we're making the client build file as static,
and then will send that if any api get's hit.
res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, "client", "build", "index.html"))
This is to send the file as a response if any api get's hit and we use the path module
to direct the file path.
path.resolve(__dirname, "client", "build", "index.html")
The above's meaning is selecting the current path and then directing to the client containing build which inturn has the 
index.html file.

Then on the server's package.json, we add the below next to the dev script.
"heroku-postbuild": "NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client"
