We want to run both the client and the server at the same time, so we will be using concurrently
which will allow us to run both at the same time.
(i) Go to the main folder location if incase the current location is somewgere inside
cd..
(ii)Add the below code in the scripts->package.json of the server.js
"client": "npm start --prefix client",
"dev":"concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\" "
--"client": "npm start --prefix client", or "client":"npm start && cd client"
This line says to run the npm after getting inside the folder client
--"dev":"concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\" "
This is to run both the server concurrently
And finally npm run dev will both the serverso npm run server for the server,
npm run client is for the clent and npm run dev is to run both the server at the same time.
